Segment-Bridge: visualized connections between words

I haven't finishing thinking about it. Fork to seek your inspirations :)

Plan
------

The words are connected to each other by their meaning in a virtual way.
I thinking about visualizing the connection by creating a map.

Think about a street, the rooms are like the words, the road is like the connections.
People will be easy to find other things related by finding one word.
In each room there are contents, where people post and comments.

The words(rooms) is placed in a list at left as a side bar.
By clicking the word, the sidebar reloads to another connection(road).
By repeating this, people wonder in the web of words.
The content shows at right, it's where people talk and leaving footprints.
